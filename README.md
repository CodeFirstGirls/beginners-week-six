# Javascript and jQuery!

Let's get started
## First Task
- Most importantly,Fork this directory into your personal account and clone it into your coding_course folder, like you did last week with the bootstrap excercise.
- Add jQuery using a CDN, make sure it is called above the other JS files. ([CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery/) is a good website for this, make sure you select 'jquery' not 'core').
- Read through the code in 'background.js', try and complete the function which will change the background when the button is clicked

## Extention task
- Using variables, change the text in the span to be the name of an artist when the background changes.
